### What is an autodidact?

Simply put, an autodidact is someone who teaches themselves.  More fundamentally, however, autodidactism means a commitment not to external accolades but to an inner drive to learn and understand more about the world, ourselves, and our place in it. It means devotion to developing one’s mind and skills to create and maintain a rich internal life  It also means examining one’s life and actively deciding what to do with it.

### Who am I?

My name is Charlotte, and I’m a full-time engineer and data scientist. I believe that the greatest gift we have is the ability to learn how to learn.  More important than any one technical skill is the ability to understand how to tackle problems and teach yourself what you need to know. I taught myself enough coding skills while in college to get a job, but I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and learn more.
